# ðŸ§  Architecture Overview: Modular Clean Architecture with Vertical Slices

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

This project follows a **Modular Clean Architecture** pattern enhanced with **Vertical Slice Design** and Domain-Driven Design principles.

It brings together the strengths of multiple architectural approaches to promote clarity, scalability, testability, and business alignment â€” all within a structured, modular setup.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Layers

| Layer                  | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Features**           | Vertical slices per domain use case (e.g., `health`). Contains controllers, handlers, and request/response DTOs.                |
| **Core**               | Shared, stateless, side-effect-free components like the Mediator, typed configs, JSON/date utilities, response builders.        |
| **Application**        | Pure business logic. Contains application services, contracts, enums, and logic orchestration (e.g., report generators).        |
| **Infrastructure**     | Interfacing layer with the outside world â€” HTTP clients, JPA persistence, repository registrars, external service integrations. |
| **Tests/Architecture** | ArchUnit rules and architecture enforcement: naming, dependency rules, layering constraints.                                    |

## ðŸ§­ Architectural Style Breakdown

### ðŸ§¼ Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin)

- **Dependency Rule**: Code dependencies point inwards, toward use cases.
- **Infrastructure (Spring, JPA, HTTP)** is replaceable.
- **Business logic is framework-agnostic.**

### ðŸ§© Modular Architecture

- Code is divided into independent units (e.g., `health`, `reporting`).
- Features are **plug-and-play** and encapsulate their full lifecycle.

### ðŸŽ¯ Vertical Slice Architecture

- Each feature (e.g., `health-status`) is built as a **cohesive unit**: controller â†’ handler â†’ service.
- Reduces coupling between features and encourages **use-case thinking** over CRUD-based layering.

### ðŸ§  Domain-Driven Design (DDD - Lightweight)

- Use-case-first structure.
- Clear separation of responsibilities (commands, handlers, services).
- Use of contracts and enums for **ubiquitous language**.

## ðŸ§ª Enforced with ArchUnit

To enforce and safeguard architectural boundaries, the project uses:

- `NoCyclicDependencyRuleTest` â€” prevents circular package dependencies.
- `LayerDependencyRulesTest` â€” validates layer integrity.
- `InjectionOnInterfacesTest` â€” enforces interface-based dependency injection.
